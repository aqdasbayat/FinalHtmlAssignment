                    Baklava is a rich and indulgent pastry that is popular in many Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and Central Asian cuisines, including Afghan cuisine. It consists of thin layers of delicate phyllo dough (or filo dough) that are filled with finely chopped nuts, typically pistachios, walnuts, or almonds, and sweetened with honey or sugar syrup.
                    The preparation of baklava involves layering the phyllo dough sheets, brushing each layer with melted butter, and then adding a generous amount of the nut mixture. Once the layers are stacked, the pastry is cut into diamond or square shapes and baked until golden and crisp. After baking, it is drenched in a syrup made from sugar, water, and often flavored with rose water or orange blossom water, which gives the baklava its signature sweetness and aromatic fragrance.
                    The texture of baklava is both flaky and crunchy, with the syrup soaking into the layers, creating a rich and sticky finish. The nuts add a satisfying crunch and a subtle earthy flavor that balances the sweetness of the syrup.
